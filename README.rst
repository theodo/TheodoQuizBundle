TheodoQuizBundle
================

This is TheodoQuizBundle. A simple bundle for managing quizes etc.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This bundle is not yet available through composer. In order to add the
bundle to your symfony2 project, please add the following repository to
the repositories already available in your ``composer.json`` file.

::

    [...]
    "repositories": [
        {...},
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/CharlyP/TheodoQuizBundle.git"
        }
    ],

Then add the bundle to the required bundles of your application below:

::

    "require": {
        ...,
        "theodo/quiz-bundle": "dev-master"
    },

Next, you only need to update your project using ``composer.phar``:

::

    $ php composer.phar update theodo/quiz-bundle

Enabling the bundle in your project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the bundle to work, you need to register it in the
``app/AppKernel.php`` class of your project, by adding it to the
registered bundles as follow:

::

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Theodo\QuizBundle\TheodoQuizBundle(),
        );
    }

Last but not least, the routing activation: You will need to load the
routing configuration of the bundle to access the web pages generated by
the bundle. To do so, edit the ``app/config/routing.yml`` file of your
project and add the following lines at the end:

::

    theodo_quiz:
        resource: "@TheodoQuizBundle/Resources/config/routing/questions.xml"
        prefix: /

Feel free to change the prefix to move the pages to another prefixed
URL.

Twitter Bootstrap dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the web interface to be as comfortable as possible, the templating
system of the bundles requires Twitter Bootstrap's stylesheets.

If you have arrived so far, it means that the Twitter Bootstrap files
are already part of your project (indeed it has been downloaded during
the ``composer update`` command of the bundle). You only need to copy
the appropriate files to the appropriate place. Don't worry, we did not
leave you alone in front of this tedious task. A script is provided,
that needs to be triggered after ``composer install`` and
``composer update`` commands. Just add to your ``composer.json`` file
the following lines:

::

    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            ...,
            "Theodo\\QuizBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::symlinkTwitterBootstrapFiles"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            ...,
            "Theodo\\QuizBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::symlinkTwitterBootstrapFiles"
        ]
    },

The last thing you will need to do to have a fully functional
``theodo/quiz-bundle`` in your project, is to launch the following
command to copy the required Twitter Bootstrap files:

::

    $ php composer.phar install

Enjoy!
